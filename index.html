        I don't know how I felt when I first saw you.
        <br>
        I don't even know how were you at that time.
        <br>
        What were you thinking about me at the time I was staring at you.
        <br>
        Probably you were thinking that "Oh! God Am I still in heaven!!! Who is she!Is she a fairy!"
        <br>
        I don't know and remember these things cause I was also a small child.
        <br>
        I always wish "Kaash tu merse 4,5 saal chota hota ". It was not kunki "Me teko bhut maarti" but 
        <br>
        because to know how I felt when I first saw you.
        <br>
        May be If tu merse kafi chota hota to ,May be I can become the most admirable person of your life!

        kher!

        Let's continue where we were.........
        The first thing I remembered about you is You asking me questioning about mummy's appearance and 
        <br>
        I don't even know it was in real or not.
        <br>
        I don't know what was the first thing you remember about me.How many memories you have with me!
        <br>
        Let me share few which I had in my mind.
        <br>
        Sharing whole day things with each other before sleeping.
        <br>
        Stealing Bourbon from slap and eating it chance by chance underneath the bed.
        <br>
        Playing at terrace when light goes!
        <br>
        Rattafication of table and you always get more marks than me in that rattafication.
        <br>
        Me believing in your gadget things and that flying one especially.
        <br>
        Purchasing random eatables from joshi uncle ki dukaan by the money we took from any places of house.
        <br>
        Never gona apart promises.
        <br>
        Growing up was really too fast!!!
        </p>
        <h1 class="headin">Your Words:</h1>
        <p id="ha">
        When you say:Di,Tu sundar lag rhi,It really boost my confident.
        <br>
        When you say You can do it for anything ,It help me overcome my fear of loosing.
        <br>
        It made me feel worth when you used to share every thing with me.
        <br>
        Being your shield in our childhood made me feel strong.<br>
        Seeing you growing up many mischivious habits made me laugh.<br>
        Your achievements used to made me proud.<br>
        Many achievements are more to achieve now!
        <br>

        Take me with you as Dhahez when you
        leave the house after marraige.I used to feel more loved!
